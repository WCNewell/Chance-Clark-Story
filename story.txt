This is a story about pulling and pushing from git.

Once upon a time there were 30 students who all came together in one place.

This lovely placed was called the land of Galvanize.

The students, all geniuses, were broken in to groups based on intelligence, Clark and Chance being at the top of the class.

By using positive affirmations we are planning to make it so.

All of the other students were asking Clark and Chance all the questions.
